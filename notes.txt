more diluted (no acid rain)
saltier from salt
fracking brines (mining salts)
high nitrogen even as p decreases
hydrologic regimes
oxygen changing with climate
diversity and concentration of contaminants
biogeochemical regimes
chemical input changes, warming changes, interactions between the two

camels/camels-chem+ms big ordination
	10 vars most commonly shared
	saltier, hotter, focus on these simplifications

10 year threshold

salinity or conductivity
nitrate or ammonium or P or pH, sulfate
Cl, Ca, Mg, K
	for the salty streams, what are their salts?
PCA of top quartile of salty streams
	

increasing, decreasing, not changing?

for ms sites with no human influence, how many showing changes?

hydro regime interaction with biogeo regimes (extreme flows can result in rapid flushing. low flow can exacerbate problematic redox-sensitive chemicals of concern)
	different river systems could be headed in different directions

make this point here?
	rivers can't get much warmer, they just start evaporating
	so instead chemical change
	wes made a poster on this with audrey and spencer

REFINE 1

plots:
fresher vs saltier (conductivity trends)
saltier how? (pca of saltiest sites)
fingerprint of coal: sulfate trends (less acid rain vs more coal mining or fly ash)
temp trends
backburner:
	o2 trends? or instead mean annual temp and o2, or annual peaks and minima, (consult joanna's grdo stuff)
		case is as rivers get warmer, o2 changes
sulfate trends
phosphate? with ortho-p?
nitrate
cl
pca of sulfateist
	start and endpoint in color (dif color)
	but for sulfate, don't need this change over time thing
	for sites increasing in salinity, show their change over time though
biplot of molar PO4 vs NO3 changing over time, with traces
	for NO3, actually use NH4 and NO2 as well? see what we have and where we can get them all
	higher N:P over time
some weird-ass thing of my own design
	put one crazy idea in emily's manuscript	

do mean annual vwc
10 years to enter
	over 15 years? over 20?
